# Native performance measurements

Measured on an Apple M3 Max, macOS 26.6.2, with Apple clang and the default
`-O3 -flto` native flags. No PGO profile was present. These are headless
simulation results, not displayed game FPS.

## OAM matrix writes

The baseline is commit `73e2fc38c`. Sampling its eight-pass benchmark at 1 ms
intervals found 742 top-of-stack samples in `BuildOamBuffer`, 469 in
`UpdateOamCoords`, and 476 in memory copies, out of 4,336 total samples.
The sample includes replay, rendering, and startup as well as timed simulation.
Pointer encoding accounted for only eight samples, so it was not changed.

The native OAM helper filled unused records, then separately wrote all 128
matrix components. It now combines the fill and matrix component for unused
records, while preserving the attributes of active records and records beyond
the OAM limit. This removes duplicate writes without caching game state.
A first version selected active/unused records inside one loop and regressed;
the retained version separates those ranges.

Results below are medians of three runs per binary, alternating run order.
Each run used eight passes, the committed Mudkip replay, 10,007 warmup frames,
and 1,000,003 measured frames per scenario. The binaries were built before
measurement and run sequentially without sampling or compilation alongside.

| Scenario | Baseline frames/s | OAM frames/s | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Overworld | 4,593,734 | 4,756,424 | +3.5% |
| Menu | 11,022,475 | 11,723,588 | +6.4% |
| Battle | 5,766,232 | 5,974,416 | +3.6% |
| Aggregate score | 7,129,347 | 7,484,339 | +5.0% |

Rendering remained approximately 97/87/89 microseconds per frame for
overworld/menu/battle. It is measured separately and excluded from the score.
All runs matched the six unchanged framebuffer goldens and passed the sprite
sort and determinism checks. `make native-test` also passed, including all
16,641 OAM count/limit combinations with unaligned buffers and guard bytes.

Run the existing benchmark with:

```sh
make native-bench native-test
build/native/pokeemerald-bench --script tools/wasm_replays/mudkip_starter.txt --golden tools/native/bench_golden.json --passes 8
```

Local raw results and the sampling report are in the ignored
`build/native/perf/` directory. Results do not establish Kindle, browser,
GUI, or PGO performance.
